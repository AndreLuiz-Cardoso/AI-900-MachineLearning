# MicrosoftAzureAIFundamentals
Training for certification Azure
Basically, I used the same step-by-step procedure demonstrated on the Azure website (https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/01-machine-learning.html)
I had some problems with the data type, because I put the wrong option, I put table instead of tubular. After fixing this part, everything went fine.
